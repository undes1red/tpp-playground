                          Historical event sequences. Commonly, this sequence is a slice of

                          When the next event actually happens.

        * mean            type: int shape: N/A
                          The mean of all $ t_i - t_{i - 1} $ in the entire dataset. Dataloader is responsible to provide
                          this value if needed.
        * var             type: int shape: N/A
                          The variance of all $ t_i - t_{i - 1} $ in the entire dataset. Dataloader is responsible to provide
